# LibRapid FFTW

This repository contains the source code for FFTW, a library for computing the
Fourier transforms in one or more dimensions and various other related operations.

I did not write this code and do not claim any ownership of it. I have merely
made some minor modifications to the source code to make it better suited to use
in LibRapid. The original source code can be found on the [FFTW website](http://www.fftw.org/).
